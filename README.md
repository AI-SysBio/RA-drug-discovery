The increasing number of available large RNA-seq datasets, combined with genome-wide association studies (GWAS), differential gene expression (DEG) studies, and gene regulatory networks (GRN) analyses have to potential to lead to the discovery of novel therapeutics. Yet, despite this progress, our ability to translate GWAS and DEG analyses into an improved mechanistic understanding of many diseases remains limited, as different analyses often disregard information about the cell-types mediating the disease.

In this repository, We compute sample-specific GRNs which enables the use of statistical techniques to compare network properties between phenotypic groups. Then, we leverage this collection of networks to rank transcription factors (TFs) according to their contribution to the observed differential gene expression between RA and control.
